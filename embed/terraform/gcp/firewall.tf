# The dedicated VPC denies ingress by default; these three rules are the
# whole policy. The stack binds eleven ports on every interface (api 3000,
# 5009, 5109; client-proxy 3002, 3003; orchestrator 5007, 5008 and the sandbox
# egress proxies 5010, 5016, 5017, 5018); 5008 is an unauthenticated control
# API and the egress proxies expect no external client, so only 3000 and 3002
# are opened, and only to the operator's CIDRs.
