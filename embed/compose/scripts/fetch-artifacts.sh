# version .env names is installable only once a tools image carrying that row
# is published. The orchestrator moves with the platform release instead
# (.env carries a release marker on it), and a release cannot know the
# checksum of a binary it has not built yet — its rows below cover the
# versions pinned before that; newer ones are verified by the .sha256 the
# release writes beside the binary (see sidecar_sha256). Superseded rows stay
# for the rollback path.
