# Proves the inline `configs:` content in compose/compose.yaml is kept in sync
# with the source copies under compose/config/. jq -j (not -r) is used because -r always
# appends its own trailing newline to whatever it prints: for a config with no
# trailing newline (clickhouse's config.xml) that would make the diff show a
# spurious final-newline difference, and for one that already ends in a single
# newline (vector.toml) it would show a spurious trailing blank line. -j joins
# raw output with no added newline, so the rendered content compares byte for
# byte against the file on disk.
#
# Unlike the rest of tests/, this file needs a working Docker daemon with the
# compose plugin (to render compose/compose.yaml) and `jq` on PATH. GitHub's ubuntu
# runners ship both, which is why `make test` runs it there; a runner without
# them fails these two tests in setup(). The same requirement is in the
# README's developer section.
