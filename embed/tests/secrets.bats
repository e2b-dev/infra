# The api's two secrets, ADMIN_TOKEN and SANDBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN_HASH_SEED, are
# per install the way the team API key is: the api-secrets one-shot writes a
# generated pair into the seed-state volume on the first start, and the api's
# entrypoint fills in whichever of the two the operator did not set. So
# compose.yaml carries no value for either, and these tests hold that line: a
# default that grew back would put every install on one shared admin token
# again, and a broken entrypoint would silently drop the api's port argument.
#
# Rendering needs Docker with the compose plugin and jq, as team-api-key.bats
# does. The render runs with both variables unset, because a value exported in
# the test runner's own shell is exactly what the api reads, so it would
# otherwise be what these assertions see.
