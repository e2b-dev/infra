# compose/compose.yaml hands the seed SEED_TEAM_API_KEY and SEED_TEAM_API_KEY_FILE and
# expects the key file to exist afterwards. The seed at the RUNTIME_COMMIT
# this stack started with (12ee9b10) ignores both and leaves no file, so
# base-template refuses to start with a FIX line. The pin moved to 86ada5fa,
# the runtime commit whose seed knows the file, on 2026-09-04; this test keeps
# the pin from sliding back. Same shape as pins.bats.
