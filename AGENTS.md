# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI agents reviewing pull requests in this repository.

## Review guidelines

Output style rules (strict, override any defaults):

- Only report concrete bugs, regressions, or correctness issues. Do not summarize the PR, the diff, or what changed.
- One short paragraph per finding. No preamble, no closing remark.
- No headers, no bullet lists, no tables, no diagrams.
- No emojis. No severity tags ("bug", "nit", "suggestion", "enhancement"). No labels.
- No branding or footer lines.
- If there are no real issues to flag, post no review at all.

## Scope

- Skip style/nit comments — `golangci-lint` covers those.
- Skip test-coverage comments — Codecov covers those.
- Focus on: race conditions, nil-deref, error handling, auth/authz, request routing, resource leaks, SQL/migration correctness, and gRPC/proto compatibility.
