// ProcSelfCgroup is where a process learns its own cgroup.
const ProcSelfCgroup = "/proc/self/cgroup"

// livenessAllowlist names cgroups that must keep running across a pause, as paths
// relative to the cgroup2 root. Every name here is OURS, and each is justified by a code
// path in the resume, not by caution -- a list that grew with the customer population
// would defeat the point of walking the hierarchy in the first place.
//
//   - init.scope holds systemd (PID 1). The resume thaw is deferred inside the /init
//     handler, so it runs after setupNFS; volume mounts are nfsvers=3 without nolock, so
//     mount.nfs needs rpc.statd, which it asks systemd to start. Freeze PID 1 and every
//     volume-mounting sandbox hangs to the NFS mount timeout and fails. Keeping systemd
//     live is also what lets envd's own Restart=always fire if envd dies mid-resume.
//   - systemd-journald.service drains the socket envd logs to (its unit has
//     Wants=systemd-journald.socket). Freeze it and once the socket buffer fills, envd's
//     own log writes block -- turning a slow resume into a wedged one.
//   - socats is envd's port forwarding. It is already excluded from the freeze today
//     (ProcessTypeSocat is absent from WorkloadProcessTypes); this preserves that.
//   - rpcbind.service holds the local portmapper, and rpcbind.socket is its activation
//     pair. nfsvers=3 mounts carry no `nolock`, so mount.nfs starts rpc.statd, which
//     registers with the LOCAL portmapper -- and the resume thaw is deferred inside the
//     /init handler, so it runs after setupNFS. Measured on a dev guest: with rpcbind
//     frozen, `rpcinfo -p 127.0.0.1` goes from answering in 0.145s to timing out, and a
//     v3 mount attempt from a clean 3.2s error to a 25s hang. The socket unit holds no
//     processes today, so freezing it stops nothing -- it is here because activation could
//     later place a process into a cgroup we froze, and rpcbind is one service in practice.
//
// Deliberately NOT here, so the list stays justified rather than merely cautious:
// run-rpc_pipefs.mount (a mount unit, 0 processes, so freezing its cgroup stops nothing)
// and systemd-resolved.service (1 process, but nothing in the resume path resolves a name
// -- the NFS target is an IP). Both are worth revisiting if a mount failure ever points
// at them; neither has a named code path today.
//
// envd's own ancestor chain is NOT here: the walk excludes it structurally, which is a
// stronger guarantee than a name match and cannot drift when the unit is renamed.

	//
	// This is the residual the walk cannot close: a cgroup created after the sweep and
