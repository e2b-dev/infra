// whose manager does not implement it (the no-op manager, the non-Linux stub) simply
// cannot be walked, which is a state the caller must handle anyway -- and discovering
// that by type assertion is honest, where a Manager full of unimplemented path methods
// would not be.

	// uninterruptible wait stays runnable until that wait returns. Callers that need

// is enumerated and then removed before it can be read is the ordinary case, not a
// fault -- systemd retires a transient unit on every timer tick.
//
// Deliberately NOT "any error". The freeze sweep's Failed count describes the tree that
// is about to be snapshotted -- a cgroup that is still there and would not take the write,
// or would not report its state -- and a predicate wide enough to swallow a vanished
// cgroup swallows that too. The resume audit can skip on any error because it only
// observes; the sweep cannot, because Failed is a count someone acts on. Only the errnos a
// removal can produce belong here, and there are
// exactly two of them. Which one arrives depends only on where the removal lands
// relative to the open, so a guard naming either one alone is half a guard:
//
//	remove, then open           -> ENOENT
//	open, then remove, then use -> ENODEV
//
// The second is a cgroupfs property, not a POSIX one: an ordinary unlinked-but-open
// file keeps serving reads, which is why this cannot be reproduced on a tmpfs tree.
