// HandoverPath is the tmpfs blob the outgoing envd writes and the incoming one

// upgrade.HandoverState (spec/upgrade/handover.proto) — an additive schema, so
// an outgoing and incoming envd built at different versions stay compatible.
// /run is tmpfs, so it never touches the rootfs diff. A var (not a const) so
// tests can point it at a temp file.

// handoverSchema is the maximum HandoverState schema this envd will read: a reader refuses a
// blob whose schema exceeds it (design §6.4 — decode every schema <= N, abort on schema > N)
// rather than mis-read a newer-than-known layout.
//
// Refusing is a hard failure, not a graceful decline. The read happens after the execve, in the
// new image, so there is no old binary left to fall back to: the handover is abandoned, the
// workload is not re-adopted, and SetHandoverResult(failed) tells the orchestrator to tear the
// sandbox down. That cost is why the version a writer STAMPS is chosen per blob
// (schemaFor) rather than pinned to this maximum.
//
// It also constrains how a change to this file is rolled back. Version resolution is
// monotonic — the upgrade target must be strictly newer than the running envd — so a reader
// can never be an older VERSION than the writer, but it can know less: a binary whose version
// sorts above the fleet's while its source predates a field refuses every blob that carries
// that field, and each refusal fails a live resume. Reverting a field here is therefore not a
// rollback while the live-upgrade flag names a target; turning that flag off is, and it takes
// effect immediately, because this blob is tmpfs and is written and read seconds apart inside
// one upgrade. Same trap for an experiment pointed at a branch build: do not aim one that
// lacks a field at a fleet whose envd has it.

// different case: there is nothing for an older reader to lose, and stamping 2 anyway would fail
// the upgrade for a peer that could have handled the blob perfectly. Empty is the common case,
