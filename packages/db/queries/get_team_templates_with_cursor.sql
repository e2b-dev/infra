-- Cursor-paginated team template listing for the CLI (GET /v2/templates).
--
-- Same projection as GetTeamTemplates (two build laterals: latest default-tag
-- build for build_status, latest ready default-tag build for the displayed
-- resources), with keyset pagination added: ordered created_at DESC (newest
-- first) and bounded by the (created_at, id) cursor and LIMIT.
