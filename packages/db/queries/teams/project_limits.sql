-- The guard is what makes a delayed retry safe: a delivery carrying a revision
-- at or below the one recorded arrived after a newer one, so it is dropped and
-- the values it carried are never written. The caller cannot enforce this on
-- its own -- it fences what it sends, and two deliveries in flight arrive in
-- whichever order the network gives them.
--
-- The conflict action takes a row lock held to commit, so a second delivery for
-- the same project waits here and is compared against the winner's revision
-- rather than against what it read.
