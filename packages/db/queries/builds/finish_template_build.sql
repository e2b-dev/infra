-- kernel_version and firecracker_version are overwritten with whatever the
-- template-manager reports back in TemplateBuildMetadata. Old template-managers
-- that do not populate those fields end up passing an empty string; the
-- NULLIF + COALESCE trick leaves the row's existing values untouched in that
-- case so we do not clobber the values the API seeded at build registration.
-- The build keeps the first terminal outcome recorded: a build failed for
-- running out of time has had its artifacts deleted, so a later success must
-- not publish it.
