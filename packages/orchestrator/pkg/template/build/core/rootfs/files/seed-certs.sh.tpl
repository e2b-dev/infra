# Seeds the tmpfs-backed /etc/ssl/certs before envd starts — shared by
# envd.service (systemd) and /etc/init.d/envd (OpenRC). See envd.service.tpl
# for the full rationale (why a tar, why a bind mount, the egress-CA contract).
#
# Every failure path here WARNS and continues deliberately: a sandbox with a
# degraded trust store is recoverable (envd's POST /init reinstalls the egress
# CA), a sandbox whose envd never starts is not.

# The copies DEREFERENCE symlinks (-L; the build-time tar already packs with
# -h): some images ship the /etc/ssl/certs bundle as symlinks into a read-only
# store, and envd's egress-proxy CA install APPENDS to
# /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt — that only works if the tmpfs copy is a
# real file, not a copied symlink to an immutable target.
