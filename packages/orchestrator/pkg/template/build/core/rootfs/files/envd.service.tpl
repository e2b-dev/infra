Description=Env Daemon Service
# Start as early as possible on cold boot: envd only needs journald's socket
# and a writable rootfs; networking is configured by the kernel (ip=) before
# userspace. Default dependencies would gate it on sysinit/basic.target
# (~0.5s), and the previous After=multi-user.target on chrony-wait (~8s).
DefaultDependencies=no
# Order after /tmp is finalized so envd doesn't answer before it's safe to stage
# files there: updateEnvd uploads an update binary to /tmp during early boot.
# On our base images (Ubuntu/Debian) /tmp is a plain rootfs dir, not a tmpfs
# mount, and systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service runs `systemd-tmpfiles --remove`
# with a `D /tmp` rule that wipes /tmp's contents at boot. That service is only
# ordered After=local-fs.target, so gating envd on local-fs.target alone leaves
# them unordered and the upload races the wipe (chmod/mv then fail ENOENT).
# Ordering after systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service closes that race.

# Seed the tmpfs from the tar packed as the build's last guest step — after all
# build steps, start_cmd, and ready_cmd, with update-ca-certificates run first
# (one sequential read); fall back to copying the cert dir, then to regenerating.
#
# Contract: the tar is the regenerated trust store captured at the end of the
# build, so it equals what update-ca-certificates would produce at boot —
# including CAs added in user layers or start/ready, registered or not. Seeding
# from it gives a complete ca-certificates.crt, so update-ca-certificates is
# skipped on cold boot (its scattered rootfs reads are the cost we avoid). It
# therefore does NOT re-merge a persisted egress-proxy CA
# (/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/e2b-ca.crt) into the bundle at boot. That CA
# is (re)installed by envd's POST /init for the current proxy, which runs before
# the orchestrator marks the sandbox running/routable — so the egress CA is
# guaranteed present for the sandbox's routable lifetime. The only gap is guest
# units that auto-start and egress over TLS before /init; that is accepted
# (revisit if a template needs boot-time egress).
