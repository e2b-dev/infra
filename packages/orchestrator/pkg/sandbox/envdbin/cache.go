// Package envdbin keeps a node-local copy of the host envd binary so the
// resume-time envd upgrade paths neither fork `envd -version` nor stream 13 MB
// off the gcsfuse mount on every attempt.
//
// Nothing on the resume path ever waits for that copy, and nothing on it reads
// BYTES off the mount. Lookup is at most two stats and a map read; a miss warms
// the cache in the BACKGROUND and tells the caller to DEFER the upgrade to a
// later resume. The one miss that starts no warm is the one whose own source stat
// failed: a warm would open by re-taking it, so that failure is reported and
// scheduled where it happened.
//
// Deferring is the one thing the cache-off path never does, and it is deliberate:
// reading the source instead would put back the cost this package exists to
// remove, on a path a customer is waiting on. The upgrade is idempotent and
// re-fires on every resume, so a deferral costs one cycle. That is the whole
// reason the design is shaped this way: a copy on the critical path would mean a
// cold, slow or wedged mount delaying a resume, and no budget can fix that — a
// read already blocked in the kernel is not interruptible from userspace, so a
// deadline bounds a copy that is progressing slowly and not one that is stuck.
// Moving the copy off the path removes the class instead of bounding it.
//
// Lookup's source stat is on the mount, and deliberately so: the cache key
// is the source's identity, which is also how a promotion becomes visible, so a
// resume necessarily stats it. That is one metadata round trip against a
// TTL-cached mount, against the demand-paged exec it replaces — and it is not
// bounded either, for the same reason as above, so a wedged mount can still hold
// a resume's lookup. What moving the copy off the path removes is the unbounded
// work: the exec and the 13 MB read.
//
// The source (/fc-envd/envd, or envd.<sha> beside it) lives on a read-only
// gcsfuse mount. Promotion overwrites the object in place (gcloud storage cp
// envd.<sha> -> envd), so the path never changes and the identity of the bytes
// has to come from size and mtime — and since two builds can be byte-identical
// in length, mtime is the load-bearing half of that key.
//
// What stat-based invalidation guarantees, precisely: this mount is the only one
// of the four created WITHOUT the shared gcsfuse config, and that config sets
// metadata-cache ttl-secs: -1 (infinite). So its metadata cache is gcsfuse's
// bounded default rather than an infinite one, and a promotion becomes visible
// here within that TTL — not instantly. The delay is benign: resumes in that
// window resolve the pre-promotion binary and skip the upgrade as same_version,
// and the next resume after it picks the new one up, because the upgrade is
// idempotent and re-fires per resume.
//
// The dependency worth stating: if /fc-envd is ever normalised onto the shared
// config, stat would stop observing promotions altogether and this cache would
// serve the pre-promotion binary indefinitely. Do not point it at a mount
// configured with an infinite metadata TTL.
