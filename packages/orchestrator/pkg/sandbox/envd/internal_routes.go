// IsInternalPath reports whether requestPath addresses an envd route reserved
// for the orchestrator's control plane. The orchestrator reaches envd over the
// host network at the sandbox slot IP, so a request for one of these paths that
// arrives through the public sandbox URL has no legitimate sender.
//
// The answer is deliberately method-agnostic: envd answers a known path with 405
// rather than 404 for the wrong method, which confirms the route exists, and a
// method added to a control route later would otherwise slip through.
//
// requestPath must be the decoded path — http.Request.URL.Path — and never
// RawPath, EscapedPath() or RequestURI. This does not percent-decode, so passing
// a still-escaped path reopens the very bypass it exists to close.
//
// Given the decoded path, cleaning before the lookup makes the answer a superset
// of what envd itself would route. envd's router matches the escaped path
// whenever it differs from the decoded one, and an escaped path differs from the
// decoded one exactly when it is not that path's canonical encoding — so the
// router can only ever reach a control route through a request whose decoded path
// is that route, spelled exactly. Cleaning only widens that: /init/, //init and
// /files/../init are refused here though envd would have 404'd them itself.
