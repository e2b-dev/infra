ARG GOLANG_VERSION=1.25.9

# The orchestrator binary is built with CGO and dynamically links against
# glibc, so the build image's glibc must be <= the host's glibc (forward
# compatibility only). The host runs Ubuntu 24.04 (glibc 2.39), so bookworm
# (glibc 2.36) is safe; do NOT bump to trixie (glibc 2.41) without also
# upgrading the host, or the binary will fail to start with
# "GLIBC_2.4x not found" errors.
