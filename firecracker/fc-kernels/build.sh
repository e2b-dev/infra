# Usage:
#   ./build.sh                            # build all versions in kernel_versions.txt for $TARGET_ARCH
#   ./build.sh <kernel_version> [arch]    # build a single version
#
# arch is one of: x86_64 (default), arm64 (kernel-style names).
# Output: builds/vmlinux-<version>/<output_arch>/vmlinux.bin where
# <output_arch> is the Go/OCI name (amd64/arm64) used by the orchestrator.
#
# CONFIG_ONLY=1 stops after olddefconfig and writes the resolved config back to
# configs/<arch>/<version>.config instead of building. Use it to settle a config
# copied from another version against the tree it will actually be built from:
# the symbols the new tree added are then in the file, and reviewable, rather
# than silently taking upstream defaults at build time. It needs an explicit
# version — it overwrites the config it reads, and doing that to every pinned
# version at once is never what anyone means.
