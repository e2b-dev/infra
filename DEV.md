# Development

## Deployment

Run `make version` and commit the changes the command generates.
Then push to `main` to deploy these changes. Changed packages will be automatically deployed.

**If the deployment fails don't run the previous commands again, just fix the error and push to `main`.**

### Errors in the env-instance-task-driver

If you are not developing env-instance-task-driver module on a unix machine you won't be able to complile the module because you will miss constants like "netlink.SCOPE_UNIVERSE".
Use the ubuntu devcontainer to develop this module.

### FC API Client

For generating the FC client use go swagger (https://goswagger.io/install.html).
Right now you need to manually check and update the [firecracker yml](./internal/client/firecracker.yml) version. It should match the version of the firecracker binary you are using specified in the [terraform file](../cluster-disk-image/variables.pkr.hcl).

### Remote development setup (VSCode)


1. Run `gcloud compute config-ssh`
2. Install "Remote SSH" extension
3. Go to the "Tunnels/SSH" tab in "Remote Explorer" extension
4. Click on config button in the SSH section
5. Select the (usually first) option: `/Users/<username>/.ssh/config`
6. Refresh the list of SSHs (you may need to reload VSCode)
7. Click on the "Connect in new window" next to the orch-client instance. This will open the remote VSCode
8. Pull this repo from GitHub via the Source control VSCode tab
9. *You may need to install `sudo apt install make` and `sudo snap install go --classic` until we add this to the default instance image*
10. The Go debugger should be attachable to the remote instance too
11. Configure git identifiers

- `git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"`
- `git config --global user.name "NAME"`

#### Developing env-build-task-driver

To debug env-build-task-driver setup remote development and then use the following methods:

- Use the [make test](./packages/env-build-task-driver/Makefile#L36) command to quickly test the build process without any Nomad interaction. You may need to override the `env` (env ID) and `build` (build ID) flags to match the build you want to test
- Use VSCode launch task `Debug env-build-task-driver` to start the build process with an attached debugger
- Use VSCode launch task `Attack to process` and search for the `env-build-` process to attach the debugger to the running env build task driver that is used by Nomad.
  - **This will restart Nomad** You may need to rebuild and replace the Nomad env-build-task driver binary with the `make update-driver-locally` command

> **This will restart Nomad** You can build and replace the current running task driver from you local machine with `make update-driver`
